# LinkedIn-Clone

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template.

I built this project using React,Redux,Materrial-ui,CSS flex-box etc..  and also used Firebase and firestore for Authentication and Database.

Aim of this project is to build a fully functional LinkedIn clone. It should have user authentication, a login page and user should able
to post a message in real time.
